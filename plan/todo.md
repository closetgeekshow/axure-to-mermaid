## Class Structure
- [ ] replace classes with functions 
  - [x] MermaidStore.js converted to functional approach
  - [x] SitemapProcessor.js converted to functional approach
  - [x] Toolbar.js converted to functional approach
  - [x] AxureToMermaid.js converted to functional approach
- [ ] eliminate use of `this`
  - [x] eliminate use of `this` (in our new MermaidStore implementation)
  - [x] eliminate use of `this` (in mermaidUtils.js)
  - [x] eliminate use of `this` (in SitemapProcessor)
  - [x] eliminate use of `this` (in Toolbar)
  - [x] eliminate use of `this` (in AxureToMermaid)
- [ ] eliminate use of #private methods and variables
  - [x] eliminate use of #private methods and variables (in our new MermaidStore implementation)
  - [x] eliminate use of #private methods and variables (in mermaidUtils.js)
  - [x] eliminate use of #private methods and variables (in SitemapProcessor)
  - [x] eliminate use of #private methods and variables (in Toolbar)

## State Management Updates
- [x] Create new `MermaidStore.js` class with proper state management
- [x] Replace current mermaidStore singleton in mermaidUtils.js with new implementation
- [x] Add subscriber pattern for state changes
- [x] Move state-dependent UI updates to use subscription model
- [x] Update `EventEmitter.js` to include static default instance
