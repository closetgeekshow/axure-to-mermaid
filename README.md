# axure-to-mermaid
## What is it
This script is designed to be used with [Axure RP](https://axure.com) (a phenomenal wireframing tool) prototypes. It creates a toolbar with options for generating a [Mermaid flowchart](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html) from your sitemap with various options for output. 

## How to use
### As a bookmarklet
I have a pre-generated minified [bookmarklet](/dist/axure-to-mermaid-injected.min.js), just click the bookmarklet to activate the [toolbar](#features].

### Inside an Axure shape
âš  Currently broken, trying to figure out why. 
~Because the bookmarklet is an [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE), you can trigger it *inside* of a prototype with the Open Link action~
1. ~Copy the full [script](/dist/axure-to-mermaid-injected.min.js) to your clipboard~
2. ~Create a new Interaction on a shape, like Click or Load~
3. ~Add the Open Link action on <br><img src="https://docs.axure.com/assets/screenshots/tutorials/navigation-menu-links2.png" alt="Open Link Screenshot" height="300">~
4. ~Set **Link to:** Link to external URL and for the value paste in the bookmarklet script~
5. ~Open the page, when you trigger the interaction, the toolbar appears~

## Features
<img width="480" alt="axure-to-mermaid toolbar screenshot" src="axure-to-mermaid-screenshot.png">
* Sitemap
  * Full: generates a markdown text of a flowchart of the entire sitemap tree
  * Current: generates a markdown flowchart using the currently selected page as the root node (Note: there currently is no way to use this button on a folder, that's Future Brent's problem)
* Code
  * Copy - copies the mermaid text to your clipboard
* Download
  * TXT - downloads text file of the mermaid chart
  * SVG - downloads svg file using Mermaid.Ink
  * PNG - downloads png file using Mermaid.Ink
* URL
  * SVG - open svg file in a new tab using the Mermaid.Ink
  * PNG - open png file in a new tab using the Mermaid.Ink 
  

> [!WARNING]  
> Features that use Mermaid.Ink[^1] will send your chart content to a third-party server.
> If you want to keep things entirely local, use only the Copy or TXT buttons and generate the chart yourself using [Mermaid.Live](https://mermaid.live/edit), Mermaid CLI or the [Mermaid JS library](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid).     

## "Dependencies"
All dependency scripts are injected from CDN sources to keep bookmarklet at a reasonable size.
* [js-base64](https://github.com/dankogai/js-base64)
* [pako](https://github.com/nodeca/pako)

## Prior art/inspiration
* [@samuei's subgraph technique](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71036087/24246712)
  * I've added styles to make the subgraphs have no visual component beyond structure
* [Mermaid.Ink](https://mermaid.ink) service allows for the generation of mermaid chart images and PDFs with just a URL

## Future Ideas
* Make it work with the Mermaid JS library instead of Mermaid.Ink. I have mermaid chart genereation working in a plugin for myself, I wanted to try to make it work with Mermaid.Ink this time.
